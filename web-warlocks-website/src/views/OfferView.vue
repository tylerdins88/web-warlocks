      This is a offerings page.

      <br />

      I want this page to be a short review of different things we use. then we create a framework
      to put them in. the website, what it does (explaining it for none developers), why we chose
      it, maybe a video explaining it?
    </h1>

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .about {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
